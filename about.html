<P>Mushroom Bakery was founded by Amelie Fairweather, she enjoys baking a lot, and shes decided to expand on those skills, she also codes in her sparetime and actually created this website. </p>
<P>Amelie is also an artist, which means designing the logo and the website was extremely fun, she lives with her family in Charlotte, she wants to use her pay for trips down to New York or San Fransisco to audition. She wants to be an Actor or something in the Film business when she grows up. </p>
<p> Everything in the cakes is completely organic and only healthy recipes. </p>
